# Statistical Pattern Recognition Methods

## Description

In the frame of Statistical Pattern Recognition nonparametric methods of supervised classification will be presented. The lessons comprise the following problems:

1. Structure of the recognition system.

2. Training set, reference set, validation set, testing set., minimum distance classifier and its modifications..

3. Feature standardisation problem.

4. Error rate estimation methods.

5. Feature selection procedures.

6. Linear classifier and algorithms of its learning.

7. The k nearest neighbor rule (k-NN) as an approximation of the bayes classifier.

8. A fuzzy k-NN rule and a scheme of its learning.

9. Multistage classifiers based on class areas and class overlap areas determination.

10. The nearest neighbor rule as an approximation of an arbitrary decision rule.

11. Reference set reduction and condensation methods

11. Potential function methods for construction of the supervised method of the classier training.

## Knowledge

Knows general structure of recognising system and a role of its elements.

Understand the terms and a role of the training set, validation set, reference set and testing set.

Knows the basic feature selection procedures and understand the dimensionality paradox.

Understand general ideas of classifier construction based on distance function and pair-wise linear classifiers.

## Skills

Is capable of feature selection performing for classifiers based on distance function.

Is able to investigate linear separability of two classes.

Knows how to construct minimum-distance classifier and the classifier based on nearest neighbor rule.

Is able to determine class overlap rate.

## Social competence

Understand necessity of tracking new methods of Statistical Pattern Recognition and new areas of their applications.

Realises the significance of Statistical Pattern Recognition in computer aided medical diagnosis making.

In case of medical application he should have awareness of a responsibility of the classifier's mistakes.
